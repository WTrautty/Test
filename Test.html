I need a python script. I have a txt file. I need it to delimit the text by appearqance of the word "routing-instance". Every chunk of text needs a couple of text checks. If the word Service-Engine0/1/0 exists. The chunk also needs to have a line containing "NIM subslot 0/1.*NIM Voice Analog Module" with the .* being a wildcard. If the word Service-Engine0/2/0 exists. The chunk also needs to have a line containing "NIM subslot 0/2.* Voice Analog Module" with the .* being a wildcard.
If the word "interface GigabitEthernet0/1/" exists, it needs to have the words "NIM subslot 0/1.* DESCR: "NIM-ES2"
If the word "interface GigabitEthernet0/2/" exists, it needs to have the words "NIM subslot 0/2.* DESCR: "NIM-ES2"

I want a line where I can insert the file path for the txt file statically.
I want a line where I can designate the file path for the exported txt file with all of the mismatches statically.
